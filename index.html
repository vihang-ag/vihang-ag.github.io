  	<h1>Vihang Agarwal</h1>
  	<p> I am currently a Masters student at the University of Michigan in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a specialisation in Computer Vision. Being a Computer Vision enthusiast, I am thrilled by the breadth of problems the community has yet to explore. I am a believer in the power of Artificial Intelligence and I want to use technology to make this world a better place to live in.

  	<p>I have had the good fortune to work with some amazing people from tackling problems in monocular robot navigation with Prof. Farshad Khorrami at New York University to exploring the minds of children through their interactions with robots, to try understanding the underpinnings of human emotions- their impact on memory, perception and cognition as a vision to pave a path for socially acceptable robots with Prof. Bishakh Bhattacharya at IIT Kanpur. At Transpacks I was involved in developing an end to end framework to detect 3D-QR code labels, reconstruct and restore them if blurry and distorted images were obtained and recognise and match patterns to extract product information delivering a low cost robust solution for a product anti-counterfeiting system.</p>
  	<p>My research interests include: Computer Vision Applications, Reinforcement learning, Human Robot Interaction, Cognitive Science and its implications to Artificial Intelligence. I am also passionate about sports and was a part of the Water Polo Team, IIT Kanpur.</p>
